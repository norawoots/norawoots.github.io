                    The two-bit addition calculator implements a series of evaluations in the form 
                    of a half and full adder to successfully output correct results in binary from 
                    two two-bit binary inputs. Like decimal addition, each two-bit input is broken 
                    into individual bits from right to left. The half adder takes in the right most 
                    input bit and evaluates if a carry is necessary (using the AND gate). If a carry 
                    is necessary, it sends the carry to the full adder, and sends the sum (output 
                    from the XOR gate) to the first output bit (rightmost). Then, the full adder 
                    evaluates the carry and the next two input bits (via a series of XOR and AND gates). 
                    The sum output goes to the second output bit (XOR gate output). If a carry is necessary 
                    in the full adder (evaluated from another AND gate), the carry is sent to the third 
                    output bit (leftmost).

                    For an example tracing, consider the following inputs: X = 11 and Y = 01. Then, breaking 
                    these inputs bit by bit, we find X<sub>0</sub> = 1, X<sub>1</sub> = 1, Y<sub>0</sub> = 1, 
                    and Y<sub>1</sub> = 0.

                    We send X<sub>0</sub> = 1 and Y<sub>0</sub> = 1 to the half adder. By the truth table, 
                    we see that two inputs of 1 necessitate a carry of 1 and an output sum (S<sub>0</sub>) of 0. 
                    Then, 0 is sent to the first output (S<sub>0</sub>) and 1 is sent to the carry-in in the full 
                    adder (C<sub>0</sub>). Next, the full adder takes in the inputs X<sub>1</sub> = 1 and 
                    Y<sub>1</sub> = 0. The two inputs are evaluated, and we find that a carry bit is not necessary, 
                    the output from the XOR gate is 1. Then, the carry-in (C<sub>0</sub>) is evaluated with the 
                    output from the XOR evaluation. The inputs to the XOR gate are 1 and 1 so the output sum 
                    (S<sub>1</sub>) is 0, which is sent to the second output bit. The same inputs are also sent to 
                    the AND gate for evaluation, which yields a carry-out of 1 sent to the third output bit (C<sub>1</sub>).
                    Thus the output is 100.

                    The two-bit subtraction calculator works similarly to the addition calculator to also successfully output 
                    correct results in binary from two two-bit binary inputs. Note that this implementation of the subtractor 
                    does not account for negative numbers. But, like the adder, the subtractor implements a successive series 
                    of gates (in the form of a half and full adder) that evaluate bits from the input.
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    For an example tracing, consider the following inputs: X = 10 and Y = 01. Then, breaking these inputs bit by bit, 
                    we find X<sub>0</sub> = 0, X<sub>1</sub> = 1, Y<sub>0</sub> = 1, and Y<sub>1</sub> = 0. We send X<sub>0</sub> = 0 
                    and Y<sub>0</sub> = 1 to the half subtractor. By the truth table, we see that these inputs necessitate a borrow of 
                    1 (B<sub>0</sub> = 1) and an output difference (D<sub>0</sub>) of 1, which is sent to the first output. Thus, 
                    B<sub>0</sub> = 1 is sent to the full subtractor, along with inputs X<sub>1</sub> = 1 and Y<sub>1</sub> = 0. 
                    Using the XOR gate, we see that the output difference from X<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> is 1, which is sent 
                    through the NOT to the AND gate to be evaluated with the borrow in bit. The two values of 1 become a 0 and 1 and 
                    produce a 0 from the AND gate, demonstrating that another borrow is not necessary and that the second output 
                    difference (D<sub>1</sub>) is 0. Thus, the output is 01.

                    Upon building these circuits, we began to consider the point at which our design became a computer, and more broadly, 
                    what generally defined a computer. During class discussions, we generated questions to unpack, including: “Is a broken 
                    computer still a computer?”, “Would computers/computation exist without humans?”, and “Does a computer need to be a physical object?”. 
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    Prior to these discussions, I think that I primarily viewed computers in the conversational way: a laptop, maybe a phone if we're stretching 
                    things, that has varied and advanced technological capabilities. I never considered that a computer might be a crab maze (Gunji, Nishiyama, 
                    Adamatzky, 2012) or that it could implement a living organism as hardware (Lu, Lopes, 2022). 
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    In fact, not only did the pre-class readings broaden my perspective on what might constitute a “computer”, it was from these pre-class 
                    readings that I began to develop my own formal working definition, an understanding that was echoed in our class discussions. 
                    Despite the fact that it was actually a fictionalized thought experiemnt, I found 
                    our final reading about an ancient rope-and-pulley computer to be the most impactful in shaping my new opinion. Dewdney (1988) 
                    originally wrote the article as a practical joke, theorizing about what an ancient computer might have looked like-- a series of 
                    logical gates built from pulleys and wood that act on a rope input. These boxes and ropes store the output values as marbles in 
                    specific holes in a binary-esque arrangement based on the ropes' positions relative to the interior pulley system. 
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    But, even though this hypothetical "computer" on a fictitious island doesn't acutally exist, Dewdney facetiously points out that 
                    “any modern computer (and its program) is conceptually translatable into Apraphulian form,” (121). Ironically, he's not wrong, even 
                    if the computer doesn't actually exist. It was from this hypothetical expeirment-- which is conceptually a computer, and thus begs the 
                    question about whether or not a computer needs a phyiscal form-- that I developed my own definition of what a computer is. Based on Dewdney's interpretation,
                    I have come to understand that our modern computers are a set of logical rules that accept and act on an input to produce an output, 
                    often including a technical and/or mathematical element.

                <h6>
                    However, what most intrigued me about our class exchanges was quantifying the necessity of human involvement in computing and 
                    computers. I can not attribute any one comment to one of my classmates, however, thematically, these 
                    discussions centered on the semantics of language, the concept of existence with and without 
                    observation, and edge cases of computing. One conclusion that we seemed to all share was that 
                    the formalized language and symbol expression of computation is human. But, we also agreed that 
                    this standardized language was developed by humans to communicate about concepts and natural 
                    occurrences that exist without humans. As such, the physical manifestations of what we are expressing 
                    and trying to understand through computation (i.e. projectile motion, weather patterns, etc.) preserve 
                    their mathematical or computational relationship with or without observation. Humans imposing their 
                    calculations onto things that exhibit mathematical patterns does not make those occurrences dependent 
                    on human calculation. But, the standard expression of calculation that we have developed does necessitate 
                    human involvement.

                    Though, after this deconstruction week, I am still wondering about considering natural phenomena 
                    as computers themselves, and in particular incorporating these natural elements into the “technological” 
                    elements that we conversationally consider to be “computers.”

                <h6>When constructing the command line GenAI assistant, I wanted the assistant to be accessible and welcoming, 
                    while simultaneously I didn't want it to be excessively anthropoglossic. Thus, for system instructions I 
                    used the phrase “Be a helpful AI assistant” to ensure that my assistant was useful and respectful, while 
                    reinforcing the fact that it was still AI.</h6>
                <h6>Next, I wanted the assistant to give user feedback while it was processing or if something went wrong so 
                    users would know what was happening on the back end. As such, I wrote some standard initial instructions 
                    that always load at the initial launch of the assistant. I built in some wait time to these initial 
                    instructions to ensure that users had time to understand them before beginning to use the assistant. 
                    Additionally, I added a “processing…” response while the GenAI assistant was generating a response.</h6>

                <h6>Expanding the GenAI assistant to web-based access, I wanted my interface to be modern and sleek 
                    to reflect the high tech feel of GenAI. As such, I used aesthetic colors and drop shadows behind 
                    my text. What's more, the buttons and links are responsive to hovering, and when active, input 
                    boxes and buttons smoothly change colors. Finally, I also implemented an instructions/home page so 
                    that users would know how to navigate the online implementation of the assistant.</h6>
                <h6>
                    Similarly to my command line assistant, I wanted users to receive some form of feedback while 
                    the assistant processed requests. As such, the response box where the GenAI response gets printed 
                    displays the text "response incoming..." until the response is printed so that users know the assistant 
                    is responding to their query.

                <h6>During the “deconstruction” portion of our discussions, we considered how and 
                    if LLMs could possess knowledge, if consciousness was required for knowledge 
                    (and by extension if LLMs were conscious), and if LLMs could “be” biased and 
                    bigoted even without a “being.”
                </h6>
                <h6>Under the rhetoric of Bergstrom and West (2025), we decided that LLMs could not 
                    possess knowledge, largely because knowledge and information had to have an inherent 
                    truth value, by definition knowledge is “justified true beliefs”. However, Bergstrom 
                    and West (2025) astutely point out that LLMs are “bullshit” machines, with bullshit 
                    defined in an academic context as “language or other forms of communication intended 
                    to appear authoritative or persuasive without regard to its actual truth or logical 
                    consistency” (Bergstrom and West, Lesson 2, 2025). Given that LLMs have no concept 
                    of a discernable truth value because they are simply probabilistic guessing machines, 
                    they have no justification, nor truth, and as such, the information that they spit out 
                    is not knowledge, and is certainly not knowledge that they possess.
                </h6>
                <h6>I particularly enjoyed our discussion about bias in these machines. Upon initial theorizing, 
                    it almost seems like these machines can not be racist or sexist or bigoted because they are 
                    not aware of their actions; they have no concept of being any of these things because they 
                    are simply trained on the data they are given. Like Plato's Allegory of the Cave (Philosophy 
                    Learning and Teaching Organization, n.d.), the LLM is analogous to one of the prisoners 
                    living in the cave, it is limited to the perception of the world that it has been given, 
                    so it can't be anything outside the context of what is programmed to be.
                </h6>
                <h6>However, during our discussions, we pushed back against these assumptions, arguing instead 
                    that just because an object is inanimate and unaware of the harm that it may be causing, 
                    it can still be bigoted, racist, sexist, etc. To say that an inanimate object can not be 
                    these things invalidates the concept of systemic discrimination and structural racism, sexism, 
                    bigotry, etc. Racism (and other forms of bigotry) are not just an ideology or an action, but 
                    almost always a structure as well, and by contributing to that racism or other form of bigotry, 
                    intentionally or not, an LLM trained on racist data is racist.</h6>
