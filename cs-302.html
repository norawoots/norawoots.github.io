                    The two-bit addition calculator implements a series of evaluations in the form 
                    of a half and full adder to successfully output correct results in binary from 
                    two two-bit binary inputs. Like decimal addition, each two-bit input is broken 
                    into individual bits from right to left. The half adder takes in the right most 
                    input bit and evaluates if a carry is necessary (using the AND gate). If a carry 
                    is necessary, it sends the carry to the full adder, and sends the sum (output 
                    from the XOR gate) to the first output bit (rightmost). Then, the full adder 
                    evaluates the carry and the next two input bits (via a series of XOR and AND gates). 
                    The sum output goes to the second output bit (XOR gate output). If a carry is necessary 
                    in the full adder (evaluated from another AND gate), the carry is sent to the third 
                    output bit (leftmost).

                    For an example tracing, consider the following inputs: X = 11 and Y = 01. Then, breaking 
                    these inputs bit by bit, we find X<sub>0</sub> = 1, X<sub>1</sub> = 1, Y<sub>0</sub> = 1, 
                    and Y<sub>1</sub> = 0.

                    We send X<sub>0</sub> = 1 and Y<sub>0</sub> = 1 to the half adder. By the truth table, 
                    we see that two inputs of 1 necessitate a carry of 1 and an output sum (S<sub>0</sub>) of 0. 
                    Then, 0 is sent to the first output (S<sub>0</sub>) and 1 is sent to the carry-in in the full 
                    adder (C<sub>0</sub>). Next, the full adder takes in the inputs X<sub>1</sub> = 1 and 
                    Y<sub>1</sub> = 0. The two inputs are evaluated, and we find that a carry bit is not necessary, 
                    the output from the XOR gate is 1. Then, the carry-in (C<sub>0</sub>) is evaluated with the 
                    output from the XOR evaluation. The inputs to the XOR gate are 1 and 1 so the output sum 
                    (S<sub>1</sub>) is 0, which is sent to the second output bit. The same inputs are also sent to 
                    the AND gate for evaluation, which yields a carry-out of 1 sent to the third output bit (C<sub>1</sub>).
                    Thus the output is 100.

                    The two-bit subtraction calculator works similarly to the addition calculator to also successfully output 
                    correct results in binary from two two-bit binary inputs. Note that this implementation of the subtractor 
                    does not account for negative numbers. But, like the adder, the subtractor implements a successive series 
                    of gates (in the form of a half and full adder) that evaluate bits from the input.
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    For an example tracing, consider the following inputs: X = 10 and Y = 01. Then, breaking these inputs bit by bit, 
                    we find X<sub>0</sub> = 0, X<sub>1</sub> = 1, Y<sub>0</sub> = 1, and Y<sub>1</sub> = 0. We send X<sub>0</sub> = 0 
                    and Y<sub>0</sub> = 1 to the half subtractor. By the truth table, we see that these inputs necessitate a borrow of 
                    1 (B<sub>0</sub> = 1) and an output difference (D<sub>0</sub>) of 1, which is sent to the first output. Thus, 
                    B<sub>0</sub> = 1 is sent to the full subtractor, along with inputs X<sub>1</sub> = 1 and Y<sub>1</sub> = 0. 
                    Using the XOR gate, we see that the output difference from X<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> is 1, which is sent 
                    through the NOT to the AND gate to be evaluated with the borrow in bit. The two values of 1 become a 0 and 1 and 
                    produce a 0 from the AND gate, demonstrating that another borrow is not necessary and that the second output 
                    difference (D<sub>1</sub>) is 0. Thus, the output is 01.

                    Upon building these circuits, we began to consider the point at which our design became a computer, and more broadly, 
                    what generally defined a computer. During class discussions, we generated questions to unpack, including: “Is a broken 
                    computer still a computer?”, “Would computers/computation exist without humans?”, and “Does a computer need to be a physical object?”. 
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    Prior to these discussions, I think that I primarily viewed computers in the conversational way: a laptop, maybe a phone if we're stretching 
                    things, that has varied and advanced technological capabilities. I never considered that a computer might be a crab maze (Gunji, Nishiyama, 
                    Adamatzky, 2012) or a 2,000 year old unearthed pulley system (Dewdney, 1988), or that it could implement a living organism as hardware (Lu, 
                    Lopes, 2022). 
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    In fact, not only did the pre-class readings broaden my perspective on what might constitute a “computer”, it was from these pre-class 
                    readings that I began to develop my own formal working definition, an understanding that was echoed in our class discussions. I found 
                    our final reading about an ancient rope-and-pulley computer to be the most impactful in shaping my new opinion. Dewdney (1988) 
                    states that “any modern computer (and its program) is conceptually translatable into Apraphulian form,” (121). The Apraphulian 
                    form in question is a series of logical gates built from pulleys and wood that act on a rope input. These boxes and ropes store 
                    the output values as marbles in specific holes in a binary-esque arrangement. Based on this interpretation, I have come to understand 
                    that our modern computers are a set of logical rules that accept and act on an input to produce an output, often including a technical 
                    and/or mathematical element.
                </h6>
                <h6>
                    However, what most intrigued me about our class exchanges was quantifying the necessity of human involvement in computing and 
                    computers. I can not attribute any one comment to one of my classmates, however, thematically, these 
                    discussions centered on the semantics of language, the concept of existence with and without 
                    observation, and edge cases of computing. One conclusion that we seemed to all share was that 
                    the formalized language and symbol expression of computation is human. But, we also agreed that 
                    this standardized language was developed by humans to communicate about concepts and natural 
                    occurrences that exist without humans. As such, the physical manifestations of what we are expressing 
                    and trying to understand through computation (i.e. projectile motion, weather patterns, etc.) preserve 
                    their mathematical or computational relationship with or without observation. Humans imposing their 
                    calculations onto things that exhibit mathematical patterns does not make those occurrences dependent 
                    on human calculation. But, the standard expression of calculation that we have developed does necessitate 
                    human involvement.

                <h6>
                    Though, after this deconstruction week, I am still wondering about considering natural phenomena 
                    as computers themselves, and in particular incorporating these natural elements into the “technological” 
                    elements that we conversationally consider to be “computers.”
